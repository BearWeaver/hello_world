Hello fellow animals of earth!

Bear here, I like green trees and clear streams.
I'm fluffy and may look cuddly, but disrespect me and I'll rip your head off grrrr!
My best friends are the honey bees and they are talented actors. If you saw us interact you'd think they don't like me because they sting me, but I know they are just acting mad because they always have honey ready for me when I come to visit...now if that doesn't convince you they're my best friends, I don't know what would.
I am the inventor of the best fruits on earth, although I don't remember inventing them, but I must have because they are named after me...bear-ies, which is the correct spelling, but hoomans get it wrong everytime so I return the dishonor in kind.
Hibernation is my favorite, I get to binge eat leading up to it, then sleep for months on end, skip the cold yucky weather, then wake with a slender figure just in time for the warmer weather. I know I look pretty, because when I emerge so do my friends the flowers, and they put on their brightest and best colors for me and my besties the bees.
Sometimes I like to play tag with the other woodland and river creatures, especially the salmon. I always win and nom-nom goes to the winner, so I nom-nom a lot.
At night I like to look up at the stars and moon. My ancestor, Big Bear, is in the sky and keeps me company.
Carl Sagan is my favorite.
GRRRRR
